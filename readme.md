This project is a playground to test MongoDb functionality using the C# driver. It uses the database that the MongoDB University course Lesson 2 (Getting Started with MongoDB Atlas) makes available. 

After a while the Database goes offline and needs to be spun up again.
The advantage of using said database is that it already contains a ton o data, and we don't have to waste time setting up. If for some reason we lose access to that, we will need to find another one or spend the time setting up something on my local machine, be it some script that creates and seeds the database on first run, or using dockers or something like that.

I followed this course https://learn.mongodb.com/learn/learning-path/using-mongodb-with-c-sharp
